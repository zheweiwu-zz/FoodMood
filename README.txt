    Chain of Command Design Pattern (Object oriented design pattern)
        This design pattern is implemented in all of the View classes. For this pattern the buttons in the view class are listened for and acted upon by the controller classes. 
        This passing of command from the view to the appropriate controller that can handle the button is what creates the chain of command.
    Structured Format Pattern (UI design pattern)
        This pattern is implemented in the add food and add mood view classes. It focuses on how users enter data. The dropdown boxes are the manifestation of this design pattern.
